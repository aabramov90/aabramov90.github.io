# Plotly Examples

Loading the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
    mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
    select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>% 
  filter(neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
         price %in% 100:500,
         room_type == "Entire home/apt") %>% 
  drop_na(rating)
```

# Plotly plots

## Scatterplot

\n puts stuff on the next line
str_c has created a new variable with those columns

Plotly works and looks like ggplot that requires the aesthetics to work.  

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```
